            <p>
              Alex became interested in Alzheimer’s disease after his
              grandmother was diagnosed two years ago. As he saw his
              grandmother’s mental health decline slowly over the past five
              years and it became apparent that completing everyday tasks like
              managing personal hygiene, navigating her home, and doing house
              chores were a struggle. Because of this, he created a project
              which focuses on the personal management of Alzheimer’s disease
              for seniors living by themselves or with limited supervision. His
              team is partnering with the UC San Diego Thornton Hospital
              Geriatrics Department and the San Diego Resource Center for
              advancing Alzheimer's Research in Minority Seniors to solve their
              project. Furthermore, they plan to do research and testing for
              this project with doctors, patients, caregivers, and families.
              Ultimately, Alex and his team hope to use the design process to
              create a solution to help seniors manage Alzheimer’s.
