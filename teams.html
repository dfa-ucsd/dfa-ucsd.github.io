          <h2>Team Lead: Alex Morrow</h2>
          <h2>Team Members: Sunny Yang, Abby Kostukovsky, Sitarah Zemar, Niki Tran, Healy Cho, Katherine Ngo, Rachel Reyes, Erin Songwang.</h2>
          <p>Alex became interested in Alzheimer’s disease after his grandmother was diagnosed two years ago. As he saw his grandmother’s mental health decline slowly over the past five years and it became apparent that completing everyday tasks like managing personal hygiene, navigating her home, and doing house chores were a struggle. Because of this, he created a project which focuses on the personal management of Alzheimer’s disease for seniors living by themselves or with limited supervision. His team is partnering with the UC San Diego Thornton Hospital Geriatrics Department and the San Diego Resource Center for advancing Alzheimer's Research in Minority Seniors to solve their project. Furthermore, they plan to do research and testing for this project with doctors, patients, caregivers, and families. Ultimately, Alex and his team hope to use the design process to create a solution to help seniors manage Alzheimer’s.</p>
